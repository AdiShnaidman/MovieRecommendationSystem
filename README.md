# **Movie Recommendation System with C++**

Explore the Movie Recommendation System project, a C++ implementation that leverages user preferences and collaborative filtering to recommend movies. This project is designed to provide personalized movie suggestions based on individual user tastes and preferences.

## **Files:**

1. **Movie.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for representing movie entities. This module encapsulates information about each movie, including details such as genre, ratings, and other relevant attributes.

2. **RecommendationSystem.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for the Recommendation System module. This core component is responsible for generating personalized movie recommendations based on user preferences and collaborative filtering algorithms.

3. **RecommendationSystemLoader.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for the Recommendation System Loader module. This module handles the loading and initialization of the Recommendation System, interfacing with data sources and setting up the system for recommendation generation.

4. **User.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for representing user profiles. This module captures user preferences, ratings, and other data necessary for the recommendation process.

5. **UsersLoader.cpp/h:** Implementation and header files for the Users Loader module. This module handles the loading of user profiles, interfacing with data sources to populate the User module.

## **Usage:**

1. Ensure a compatible C++ compiler is installed.
2. Compile the project using the provided makefile or build script.
3. Run the executable, interacting with the system to add movies, rate films, and receive personalized movie recommendations.

## **Acknowledgments:**

This project was developed as part of an exploration into recommendation systems and collaborative filtering techniques, done during my BSc studies. The Movie Recommendation System demonstrates how user preferences can be used to generate personalized suggestions, enhancing the movie-watching experience.

Feel free to dive into the codebase, experiment with different movie datasets, and contribute to the evolution of this movie recommendation system.
